# Marlowe Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

Marlowe Improvement Proposals (MIPs) describe standards, processes; or provide general guidelines or information to the Marlowe Community. It is a formal, technical communication process that exists off-chain. MIPs do **not** represent a commitment of any form towards existing projects. Rather, they are a collection of sensible and sound solutions to common problems within the Marlowe ecosystem. MIPs evolves around different statuses, driven by one or more authors:

| Status   | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---      | ---                                                                                                                            |
| Draft    | The idea has been formally accepted in the repository and is being worked on by its authors.                                   |
| Proposed | A working implementation exists, as well as a clear plan highlighting what is required for this MIP to transition to "Active". |
| Active   | The proposal is deemed to have met all the appropriate criteria to be considered Active.                                       |
| On Hold  | The MIP author is not currently working on this effort.                                                                        |
| Obsolete | The MIP was either retired or made obsolete by a newer MIP.                                                                    |
| Rejected | There is some issue with the MIP that makes it not acceptable at this point.                                                   |

It is therefore quite common for proposals and implementations to be worked on concomitantly. Even more so that a working implementation (when relevant) is a mandatory condition for reaching an `Active` status. 

The entire process is described in greater detail in [MIP-1 - "MIP Process"](./MIP-0001).
